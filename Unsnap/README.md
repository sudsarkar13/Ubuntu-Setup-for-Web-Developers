## Introduction

Quickly and easily migrate from using `snap` for applications to `flatpak`. unsnap runs as a two-stage process. unsnap itself generates the scripts to do the actual migration. This enables users to view and/or edit the scripts prior to execution to validate or tweak them.

## Running unsnap

Simply clone this repo and then run `unsnap`. After some warnings and checks, this will generate a set of scripts. Run those generated scripts in sequence to achieve unsnappyness.

``` {.bash}
git clone https://github.com/popey/unsnap
cd unsnap
./unsnap
```

Alternatively run `unsnap` with the `auto` option to generate **and** run the scripts immediately.

``` {.bash}
./unsnap auto
```

## Generated Scripts

These scripts are generated by unsnap.

* **00-backup** - runs `snap save` for each installed snap being migrated
* **01-install-flatpak** - if not already installed, will install flatpak package manager
* **02-enable-flathub** - if not enabled, will add the remote flathub location in flatpak
* **03-install-flatpaks** - installs equivalent flatpaks for each identified snap
* **04-remove-snaps** - removes snaps for which the flatpaks have been installed
* **99-remove-snapd** - removes `snapd` itself, which will remove all snaps

## Package Mapping

unsnap ships with a [applist.csv](./applist.csv) file that contains a mapping of snap package names to flatpak names. This is a one to one mapping. The list is not complete, but contains a subset of applications available in the snap store and flathub. Contributions to this list are most welcome

## Check Mode

To facilitate checking the snap and flatpak names in the [applist.csv](./applist.csv) file, unsnap has a "check" mode. This simply runs through the [applist.csv](./applist.csv) file to check for the existence of every snap and flatpak listed. For this mode to work, both the snap and flatpak commands should be installed. This is an unsnap developer feature, and typically isn't required to be run by users.

``` {.bash}
./unsnap check
```

*Note*: In this mode, no scripts are generated, no data is changed, and no flatpaks are installed, but an `unsnap.log`file is generated.

## Application data

Currently unsnap runs a `snap save` for each snap being migrated. This uses the `snapd` internal mechanism to backup application data. You should ensure you have enough disk space and time for this operation, as some applications will have a lot of data to backup.

More information about `snap save` can be found in the [snap snapshots documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapshots).

The backup can be skipped by omitting running the backup scripts before starting the migration proper.

The backups made with `snap save` are (by default) stored in `/var/lib/snapd/snapshots` as zip files.

It's (currently) left as an exercise for the user, to actually *restore* the data, should they need to.

## Logging

unsnap writes to the console, and to a log file called `unsnap.log` in `./log-YYYY-MM-DD.HH.MM.SS` beneath the current directory.
