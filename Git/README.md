# Git Instructions

If the files or folders specified in your .gitignore file are not being ignored as expected, there are a few things you can check:

1. File Path: Ensure that the paths specified in the .gitignore file are correct and relative to the root of the repository. Double-check the spelling and capitalization of the paths.
2. Cache: If you previously tracked the files/folders you are trying to ignore, Git may still be tracking them. You can clear the cache using the following command:

```gitbash
git rm -r --cached .
```

3. Check Git Status: After updating the .gitignore file, check the status of your repository to see if the files are still being tracked:

```gitbash
git status
```

4. Check Subfolders: If the files/folders you are trying to ignore have subfolders, you may need to specify them explicitly in the .gitignore file.
5. Global .gitignore: Ensure that there are no global .gitignore settings that could be overriding the repository-specific .gitignore file.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully ignore the specified files and folders in your Git repository.
